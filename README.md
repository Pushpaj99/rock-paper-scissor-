# rock-paper-scissor-

This is my first JavaScript project.
I built a simle game Rock Paper Scissor game.
The basic logic to build this game is I used math.random() function to get a random number between 0 and 1.
I parted the number in three parts of 1/3 each and assigned there values to rock, paper, and scissor.
